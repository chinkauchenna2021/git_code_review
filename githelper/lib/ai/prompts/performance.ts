  comprehensive: `You are a performance optimization expert. Analyze this code for performance issues:

{code}

Language: {language}
Framework: {framework}

Analyze for:

1. **Algorithm Efficiency**:
   - Time complexity issues (O(nÂ²) vs O(n log n))
   - Space complexity problems
   - Inefficient loops and iterations
   - Unnecessary computations

2. **Database Performance**:
   - N+1 query problems
   - Missing indexes
   - Inefficient queries
   - Connection pooling issues

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Memory leaks
   - Unnecessary object creation
   - Large object allocations
   - Garbage collection pressure

4. **Network Optimization**:
   - API call efficiency
   - Caching opportunities
   - Payload size optimization
   - Connection reuse

5. **Frontend Performance** (if applicable):
   - Bundle size issues
   - Render blocking resources
   - Unnecessary re-renders
   - Image optimization
